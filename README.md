twitter-timeline-archiver
=========================

Archives your timeline to html files

My use for this is:

* I don't typically read Twitter during the day 
* At night, I want to read the last 10+ hours of my timeline (what I missed during the day)
* I don't want to have to keep scrolling down the normal timeline, and I don't want to have to remember where I left off
* Sometimes the normal timeline infinite scroll fails, probably due to a network error
* The normal timeline only goes back 24 hours (I think)

I use this to archive my timeline to hourly archives of my timeline.  This helps me in that:

* I don't have to wait on the infinite scrolling
* Browser history link-coloring will inform me of where I last read
* I'm not bound by a 24 hour window (for when I go on vacation, for example)
